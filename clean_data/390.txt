panel flutter study piston theory use piston theory recently advocate supersonic aeroelastic analysis include problem panel flutter stimulate investigation report linear piston theory mainly consider effect introduce high order term discuss flutter rectangular simply support panel elliptically shape clamp edge panel consider justification provide use static aerodynamic force neglect aerodynamic damp conclude ackeret loading give exact result piston theory solution flutter equation apply galerkin method rayleigh type analysis assume mode deformation
