effect ground proximity aerodynamic characteristic engine vertical land transport airplane model tilt wing propeller investigation study effect ground proximity aerodynamic characteristic engine vertical land transport airplane model tilt wing propeller test wing angle incidence 90 position vertical landing model height ground lift drag pitching moment measure tuft study determine flow field cause propeller slipstream datum obtain complete model model horizontal tail remove wing propeller combination result investigation show model hover near ground strong upwash plane symmetry increase lift 10 percent propeller thrust half lift result increase propeller thrust half result load fuselage induce upwash model approach ground experience increase nose pitch moment evidently result load fuselage rear long addition horizontal tail locate halfway vertical tail increase nose pitch moment fuselage decrease energy upwash reach tail
