new theory buckling thin cylinder axial compression bending result experiment axial loading cylindrical shell thin buckle elastic limit short buckle euler column good agreement previous theory base assumption perfect initial shape infinitesimal deflection experimental failure stress range 0.6 0.15 theoretical discrepancy apparently considerably great brass mild steel specimen duralumin increase radius thickness ratio equally great discrepancy observed predict shape buckling deflection paper approximate large deflection theory develop permit initial eccentricity deviation cylindrical shape consider true instability course impossible condition stress distribution longer uniform assume final failure take place maximum stress reach yield point effect initial eccentricity large deflection great case simple strut measurement initial eccentricity actual cylinder show discrepancy explain initial deviation cylindrical form assume resolve double harmonic series certain reasonable assumption magnitude component deviation assumption fail stress find function yield point modulus elasticity radius thickness ratio basis tentative design formula 5 proposel involve relation suggest theory base experimental datum show similar discrepancy experiment previous theory buckling thin cylinder pure bending reasonably explain basis maximum bending stress take 1.4 time value give equation buckling problem probably explain similar consideration hope discussion help open new field study buckling problem large deflection theory develop paper useful explore field application paper present result new test thin cylinder axial compression bending numerous test lundquist form experimental evidence conclusion arrive
