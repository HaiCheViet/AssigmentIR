axially symmetric turbulent compressible mixing presence initial boundary layer recent experimental result show mixing heterogeneous gas have initial velocity ratio close unity occur faster predict classical eddy viscosity theory theoretical analysis uniform stream different gas nearly equal velocity perform usual assumption eddy viscosity prandtl number equal constant show mixing place slowly e rate correspond laminar diffusion suggest difference analysis experiment attribute presence boundary layer experiment purpose note use classical eddy viscosity law admit existence boundary layer sufficient explain rapid mixing observe physically instead show rapid mixing explain basis different eddy viscosity law suggest ref conclusion obtain application analysis present briefly
