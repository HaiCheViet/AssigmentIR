mixing theory interaction dissipative flow nearly isentropic stream mean simplify theoretical model    present paper treat general class flow problem characterize interaction viscous dissipative flow near surface solid body wake outer nearly isentropic stream present external flow take plane steady supersonic flow make small angle plane surface plane symmetry method extend curve surface axially symmetric supersonic flow subsonic flow internal dissipative flow regard quasi dimensional parallel surface average properly define mean velocity mean temperature nonuniformity actual velocity distribution take account approximately mean relation mean temperature mean velocity mix transport momentum outer stream dissipative flow consider fundamental physical process determine pressure rise support flow aid concept large number flow problem show basically similar boundary layer shockwave interaction wake flow blunt base body base pressure problem    flow separation overexpanded supersonic nozzle separation wing body etc
