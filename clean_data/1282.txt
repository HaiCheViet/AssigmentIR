compressible flat plate boundary layer flow apply magnetic field laminar boundary layer equation formulate solve flat plate high speed compressible air flow equilibrium dissociation ionization assume apply magnetic field have component normal plate proportional skin friction heat transfer characteristic determine free stream velocity meter sec magnetic field result skin friction heat transfer give free stream velocity decrease increase magnetic field strength percentage reduction constant length plate exhibit hysteresis behavior find case magnetoaerodynamic couette flow flat plate hysteresis effect disappear high mach number furthermore find reduction heat transfer increase field strength opposite behavior couette flow
