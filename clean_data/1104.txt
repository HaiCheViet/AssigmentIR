aerodynamic heating blunt nose shape mach number 14 result present recent investigation aerodynamic heating rate blunt nose shape mach number 14 datum obtain flight wind tunnel test show flat faced cylinder 50 percent stagnation point heating rate hemisphere nearly entire mach number range test mach number 2 series body hemispherical segment vary radius curvature show slight amount curvature decrease local rate edge flat faced cylinder slight increase stagnation rate total heat transfer slightly curve body somewhat small total heat transfer flat faced cylinder comparison test theoretical heating rate distribution show laminar turbulent local rate predict available theory give pressure distribution body reasonably scatter available datum leave open choice theory edge body usually differ test flat faced cylinder mach number 2.49 angle attack 15degree show movement apparent stagnation point center body 50 percent windward station crease 30 percent near leeward edge decrease 20 percent 15degree angle attack preliminary result concave nose indicate possibility type design develop heating rate significantly lower flat faced cylinder rate test result show existence unsteady flow phenomenon increase heating rate extremely high value
