induction drag large negatively charge satellite move magnetic field free ionosphere induction drag experience charge satellite traversal ionosphere theoretically postulate author previous exact treatment problem inapplicable large system semiempirical approach jastrow pearse yield somewhat questionable result present description initially consider satellite completely permeable spherical shell charge avoid difficult boundary condition introduce exact linearized treatment effect permeability show approximately removable mean iterative process final result apparently valid order magnitude obtain drag force arise solely electrical effect magnitude considerably obtain jastrow pearse
