simplify approximate method calculation pressure conical body arbitrary shape supersonic hypersonic flow exact conical flow solution available circular cone zero angle attack nonaxisymmetric cone cone angle attack approximate method exist method generally complicated limited certain body shape certain mach number range great need feel simple approximate method applicable arbitrarily shape conical body zero incidence angle attack method develop recently lockheed present abbreviate form method base equivalent cone theory theory determine pressure conical body utilize information symmetric cone zero angle attack normal component free stream respect surface local element body consider method work relatively high mach number inconsistent low mach number especially body deviate considerably circular cone equivalent cone method satisfactory result mainly fact consider local surface element body independent body element newtonian theory manner
