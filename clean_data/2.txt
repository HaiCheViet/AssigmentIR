simple shear flow past flat plate incompressible fluid small viscosity study high speed viscous flow past dimensional body usually necessary consider curve shock wave emit nose lead edge body consequently exist inviscid rotational flow region shock wave boundary layer situation arise instance study hypersonic viscous flow past flat plate situation somewhat different prandtl classical boundary layer problem prandtl original problem inviscid free stream outside boundary layer irrotational hypersonic boundary layer problem inviscid free stream consider rotational possible effect vorticity recently discuss ferri libby present paper simple shear flow past flat plate fluid small viscosity investigate show problem treat boundary layer approximation novel feature free stream constant vorticity discussion restrict dimensional incompressible steady flow
