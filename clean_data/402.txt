magnetohydrodynamic shock mathematical treatment couple motion hydrodynamic flow electromagnetic field give simplifying assumption introduce conductivity medium infinite second motion describe plane shock wave orientation plane shock magnetic field discuss separately extreme relativistic unrelativistic behavior examine special consideration give behavior weak shock sound wave interesting note wave degenerate common sound wave common electromagnetic wave extreme case weak strong magnetic field
