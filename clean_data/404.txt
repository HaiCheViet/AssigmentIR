dimensional transonic flow past airfoil report concern problem construct solution transonic flow symmetric airfoil aspect problem emphasize necessity form solution compressible flow simplify initial phase problem mapping incompressible flow case symmetric joukowski airfoil circulation mapping relatively simple coefficient power series difficult evaluate result problem require simplification instead exact incompressible flow past airfoil approximate flow derive combination source sink flow differ slightly exact thickness small method flow circulation consider incompressible flow function approximate fashion numerical calculation corresponding compressible flow hodograph theory present essential difficulty
