steady magnetohydrodynamic flow past non conduct wedge paper present study steady dimensional magnetohydrodynamic flow infinitely conduct fluid past nonconducting wedge nonaligned flow magnetic field flow consider superfast fully hyperbolic regime flow consist region uniformity connect shock expansion wave boundary condition magnetic field magnetic field region wedge flow region couple unlike case ordinary supersonic gasdynamic small wedge angle weak wave characteristic consider problem linearize explicit solution obtain qualitatively similar nonlinear solution interesting unexpected feature arise discuss detail
